Description: 
    Provides a centralized conda installation for use by other Bioconductor packages.
    If conda is not already available on the system, it is downloaded and installed from the Miniforge project; otherwise, no action is performed.
    Historically, this package was used to provide a Python installation for basilisk, hence the name.
